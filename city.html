                The oldest traces of human occupation in Paris are human bones and evidence of an encampment of
                hunter-gatherers dating from about 8000 BC, during the Mesolithic period.[1] Between 250 and 225 BC, the
                Parisii, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, settled on the banks of the Seine, built bridges and a fort,
                minted coins, and began to trade with other river settlements in Europe.[2]

                In 52 BC, a Roman army led by Titus Labienus defeated the Parisii and established a Gallo-Roman garrison
                town called Lutetia.[3] The town was Christianised in the 3rd century AD, and after the collapse of the
                Roman Empire, it was occupied by Clovis I, the King of the Franks, who made it his capital in 508.
